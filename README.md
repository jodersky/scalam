scalam
======

Scalam is a scientific calculation utility library. It's main purposes and features are:
-  seamless conversions between standard Scala collections and high-performance numeric data structures from [breeze](https://github.com/scalanlp/breeze])
-  generation of matlab code for plotting nice scientific graphs

Its reason of existence is mainly due to my subjective opinion that Scala is an elegant, expressive language but misses scientific graphing libraries whereas Matlab is a horrible language but features mature and accurate graphing capabilities. Scalam was created for analyzing data obtained in my physics labs. It is no longer maintaned.
